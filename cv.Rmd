aboutme: |
  \RaggedRight My training and interests lie at the intersection of social psychology, neuroscience, and positive psychology. One of my research areas deals with the mind-body connection, for example through exploring alterations in the sense of embodiment, the placebo effect, and mindfulness. A second central research area of mine focuses on prosociality: empathy, perspective-taking, altruism, loving-kindness, and self-control. I am also passionate about open science, reproducible science, and data science using R (this CV was made in R too).

#### SHORT VERSION ####
#######################

# Whether to print a shortened version of the CV
short <- FALSE

########################
#### PACKAGE SETUP #####
########################

# Required packages
library(vitae)
library(dplyr)

# For Google scholar data/visualization
library(scholar)
library(ggplot2)
library(forcats)
library(patchwork)
library(see)
library(rsvg)

# To format links throughout the CV
source("files/format_links.R")

########################
#### GOOGLE SCHOLAR ####
########################

# Specify your Google scholar profile
scholar.profile <- "NrfwEncAAAAJ" # Get it from your Google Scholar profile URL

# Specify your Google scholar short author name
author.name <- "rém thériault"
# Note: correct name may vary (e.g., if you inconsistently used middle name initials)
# Dominique Makowski's was simply "d makowski", so the pattern is unclear 
# But usually it seems 1-3 letters from first name plus full last name

# When in doubt, the correct author name can be obtained through:
# source("files/get_scholar_name.R") # (after defining 'scholar.profile' above)

# Name inconsistencies should be corrected manually in file 'files/make_data_impact.R' (lines 14-16).
